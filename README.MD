# CKQwixx On-Line Game Design and AI Tutorial

First, and absolutely foremost, let me say THANK YOU to Gamewright for allowing me to use their fabulous game for this project.  I can't encourage you enough to pick up a copy (or 10 to hand out to friends, seriously I do this all the time!).  All ages are challenged, rules fit on one side of one page, everyone stays engaged and you can complete a game in 15-20 min!  

You can find it at many local retailers (support your local game store please), big box retailers, Amazon (no affiliate links) or https://gamewright.com/product/Qwixx .  Qwixx has won many prestigious awards including:
* Mensa Select
* 2011 Spiel des Jahres Finalist
* Parents' Choice Silver Honor
* Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Award
* Dr. Toy's Best Vacation Products
* and many more...

## The journey
Before I get started, let me say "I am married to my spouse, nothing else!"  So if there is a better way to do anything in the code, or framework, or anything, please let me know.  You can fork and do a pull request I will change it, or tell me and I will add it to the punch list.  Thank you!

A couple quotes to keep us motivated on the sometimes hard slog of coding...
**“It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the journey that matters, in the end.”
― Ursula K. Le Guin, The Left Hand of Darkness**

and

**“We should not judge people by their peak of excellence; but by the distance they have traveled from the point where they started.”
― Henry Ward Beecher**

Why these are so important is because you can start anywhere along the path I lay out below, but it is the dialy/weekly learnings that mark the progress, not nessisarially how fast you get to the outcome desire.

On to the coding...

My goal was to find a test harness to learn how to create an online boardgame that uses a solid AI for opponents.  Here are the main steps outlined below:

My steps to learning a few new skills:
* Understand html
* Understand css and css-grid
* Understand JavaScript client side
* Program basic 1 player game in browser
    * this is the step I am on currently
* Understand Node.js server side JavaScript
* Understand Webservers and Socket.IO
* Program basic 2 player game using Node.js
* Program basic 5 player game using Node.js
* Understand SQL
* Program ability to save game state
* Program ability to alert next player of their turn
* Program deterministic (rules based) AI opponents
* Program probabilistic AI looking at other players moves
* Program reinforcement AI training
* Get a snack!
