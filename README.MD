# CKQwixx On-Line Game Design and AI Tutorial

First and absolutely foremost let me say THANK YOU to Gamewright for allowing me to use their fabulous game for this project.  I can't encourage you enough to pick up a copy (or 10 to hand out to friends, seriously I do this all the time!).  All ages are challenged, rules fit on one side of one page, everyone stays engaged and you can complete a game in 15-20 min!  

You can find it at many local retailers (support your local game store please), big box retailers, Amazon (no affiliate links) or https://gamewright.com/product/Qwixx .  QWIXX has won many prestigious awards including:
* Mensa Select
* 2011 Spiel des Jahres Finalist
* Parents' Choice Silver Honor
* Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Award
* Dr. Toy's Best Vacation Products
* and many more...

On to the coding..
