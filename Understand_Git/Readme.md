# Understand Git


Before we do anything else a really solid understanding of Git will help in EVERYTHING you do.  (well as far as coding at least :-) )  I use github for all my public code repositories.

Some videos/series that I would recommend on the subject are: 

* Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners   by: Traversy Media
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc
* Git Tutorial for Beginners    by: Corey Schafer
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4&list=PL-osiE80TeTuRUfjRe54Eea17-YfnOOAx

Even reviewing them again every few months is a good habit I am trying to get (git) into!
